**# PyPasswordManager ‚å®Ô∏è
A very basic password manager coded in python. Makes use of libraries such as tkinter, customtkinter and cryptography modules

In order to get started, You will need to have the latest version of Python3 installed, at the time of development this was 3.13.2

Then install tkinter, customthinkter and cryptography packages so that the program will run.

Run the application and create you first password file key and enjoy :)

This was created during my first year of my Computer Science degree just as something fun to do om the side of my studies 

Development took a couple of hours but it was created to reinforce my python programming skills as it has been a while

Thanks :) ü§ñ
